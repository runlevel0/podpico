## Current Technical Status

### Backend Implementation Status
- **Commands Module**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (stubs with proper signatures)
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (comprehensive error types)
- **Database Module**: üü° STUB (needs schema implementation)
- **RSS Manager**: üü° STUB (needs feed parsing implementation)
- **USB Manager**: üü° STUB (needs device detection implementation)
- **File Manager**: üü° STUB (needs download implementation)
- **Episode Manager**: üü° STUB (needs coordination logic)
- **Config Manager**: üü° STUB (needs file I/O implementation)

### Frontend Implementation Status
- **Basic React App**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Tauri default template)
- **3-Pane Layout**: üü° PLANNED (needs implementation)
- **Podcast Management UI**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
- **Episode List UI**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
- **USB Device UI**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED

### Database Status
- **Schema Design**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (in implementation plan)
- **Table Creation**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Migration System**: ‚ùå NOT PLANNED
- **Test Data**: ‚ùå NOT CREATED

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Session 1)
1. **Implement Database Schema** - Create SQLite tables from implementation plan
2. **Basic Database Operations** - Implement CRUD operations for podcasts
3. **Test Database Integration** - Verify database operations work via Tauri commands
4. **Create First UI Component** - Basic podcast list display

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- Database tables created and accessible
- Can add/remove podcasts via backend commands
- Basic frontend component shows data from backend
- Application compiles and runs without errors

## Known Issues and Blockers

### Current Issues
- None at this time

### Technical Debt
- All backend modules need full implementation (currently stubs)
- Frontend needs complete redesign from default template
- No testing framework set up yet
- No CI/CD pipeline configured

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Compilation**: ‚úÖ CLEAN (no errors or warnings)
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ùå 0% (no tests written yet)
- **Documentation**: üü° PARTIAL (TODO comments in place)
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ GOOD (comprehensive error types defined)

### Performance Baseline
- **Application Startup**: Not measured yet
- **Memory Usage**: Not measured yet
- **Bundle Size**: ~20MB (estimated, needs measurement)

## Architecture Decisions Log

### Decided
- **Framework**: Tauri (vs Electron) - for performance and resource efficiency
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript (vs Vanilla JS) - for component reusability
- **Database**: SQLite (vs PostgreSQL) - for simplicity and local storage
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with thiserror - for comprehensive error management

### Pending Decisions
- **Frontend State Management**: Redux vs Context API vs simple state
- **Testing Framework**: Which testing approach for Rust backend
- **UI Component Library**: Custom vs existing library
- **Data Migration Strategy**: How to handle schema changes

## Session History

### Session 0 - 2025-05-31 (Initial Setup)
**Completed:**
- Project initialization and setup
- Complete backend architecture implementation (stubs)
- Dependencies configuration
- Development environment verification

**Issues Encountered:**
- Sysinfo API compatibility (resolved)
- Initial compilation took time due to dependency compilation

**Next Session Focus:**
- Database schema implementation
- First functional feature (add podcast)
