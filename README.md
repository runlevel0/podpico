# PodPico - AI-Assisted Desktop Podcast Manager

A modern, lightweight desktop application for managing podcast subscriptions and transferring episodes to USB devices, built with Tauri and Rust.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development System

This project is designed for **incremental development across multiple AI agent sessions**. Each session builds upon the previous work using a comprehensive tracking and handoff system.

### Quick Start for AI Agents

1. **Read the context files** in this order:
   - `ai_assisted_development/ProductOverview.md` - Product vision, user stories, and acceptance criteria
   - `ai_assisted_development/PROGRESS.md` - Current status and next priorities
   - `ai_assisted_development/AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete development guidelines
   - `ai_assisted_development/SESSION_NOTES.md` - Historical session details
   - `ai_assisted_development/ISSUES.md` - Known blockers and technical debt
   - `ai_assisted_development/QUALITY_METRICS.md` - Quality status and targets

2. **Verify environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/patrick/Workspaces/podpico
   cargo check && npm run tauri dev --help
   ```

3. **Start development** following the session template in `ai_assisted_development/AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## 📋 Project Status

- **Phase**: 1 (MVP Core)
- **Week**: 6 (Quality Infrastructure + Frontend Implementation Debt Resolution)
- **Overall Progress**: 28% Complete (5/18 user stories truly functional) 🔴 **DOWN FROM INCORRECTLY REPORTED 56%**
- **Next Priority**: Frontend Implementation for Backend-Ready User Stories (#3, #4, #8, #9, #10)
- **Critical Issue**: 5 user stories have complete backend but missing frontend UI

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- **Framework**: Tauri v2 with Rust backend
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLx
- **Error Handling**: Custom `PodPicoError` enum
- **Modules**: Complete structure with stub implementations

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS (TBD: component library decision)
- **State Management**: TBD (React hooks vs Redux)

### Key Features (Implemented/Planned)
- ✅ RSS feed podcast subscription management
- ✅ Episode download and local storage
- 🔄 USB device detection and file transfer (detection ✅, transfer ✅, removal pending)
- ✅ Episode status tracking (New/Unlistened/Listened)
- ⏳ Configurable settings and preferences

## 🎯 Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Core (Weeks 1-6)
- ✅ **Week 1-2**: Project setup and basic infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Week 3-4**: Podcast management - PARTIAL (5 user stories truly complete, 5 missing frontend)
