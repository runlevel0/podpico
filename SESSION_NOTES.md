**Theme System:**
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #646cff;
  --background-color: #242424;
  --surface-color: #1a1a1a;
  --text-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);
  /* ... additional theme variables */
}
```

**Layout Structure:**
- **Header**: Fixed height with podcast addition form and branding
- **3-Pane Main**: Flexible sidebar, episode list, and detail panes
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-friendly layout adjustments

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

#### Issue 1: CSS Layout Complexity
- **Problem**: Initial 3-pane layout had sizing and overflow issues
- **Root Cause**: Improper flexbox configuration and missing overflow handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Used `flex: 1` properly for main content area
  - Added `overflow: hidden` to prevent layout breaking
  - Implemented proper scrolling in individual panes
- **Impact**: Professional, stable layout matching email app design patterns

#### Issue 2: Episode Status Update Flow
- **Problem**: Status updates felt slow and unresponsive
- **Root Cause**: Waiting for backend response before UI update
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
  - Backend persistence happens asynchronously
  - Error handling with rollback on failure
- **Impact**: Responsive, modern user experience meeting user expectations

#### Issue 3: Performance Monitoring Implementation
- **Problem**: Needed to validate 3-second acceptance criteria for User Story #2
- **Root Cause**: No performance measurement in place
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `Date.now()` timing around episode loading
  - Console logging with warnings if criteria not met
  - Performance data available for optimization decisions
- **Impact**: Continuous validation of acceptance criteria compliance

#### Issue 4: Combined Inbox Logic
- **Problem**: Complex logic for showing all new episodes vs podcast-specific episodes
- **Root Cause**: Single episode list component handling multiple view modes
- **Solution**: 
  - Used `selectedPodcast` state to control filtering
  - Backend `get_episodes()` accepts optional podcast_id parameter
  - Conditional rendering based on view context
- **Impact**: Clean separation of concerns with intuitive user experience

#### 3. Commands Integration ‚úÖ
**Objective**: Integrate RSS validation with database operations

**User Story #1 Complete Implementation:**
```rust
pub async fn add_podcast(rss_url: String) -> Result<Podcast, String>
```

**Implementation Flow:**
1. **Validate RSS feed** (5-second timeout) - meets acceptance criteria

- Creates all tables on first run
- Initializes global managers (database, RSS) for command access
- Comprehensive error handling with application exit on failure

**Database Connection:**
- Uses SQLite with local file storage
- Connection string: `sqlite:./data/podcasts.db`
- Automatic table creation on startup

**UI Components:**
- Podcast addition form with real-time validation
- Podcast list with metadata display (title, URL, description, episode counts)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading indicators during RSS processing

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

#### Issue 1: SQLite Connection Path
- **Problem**: Database connection failed with "unable to open database file" error
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect SQLite URL format and missing file creation
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed from `sqlite://` to `sqlite:` URL format
  - Added explicit database file creation before connection
  - Used local `./data` directory instead of system data directory
- **Impact**: Database now initializes successfully on all platforms

#### Issue 2: Rust Borrow Checker Error
- **Problem**: Cannot use `episodes` after moving it in for loop
- **Root Cause**: `for item in episodes` moves the vector, preventing later access to `episodes.len()`
- **Solution**: Changed to `for item in &episodes` to borrow instead of move
- **Impact**: Can now access episode count after processing episodes

#### Issue 3: Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: `dirs` crate not found during compilation
- **Root Cause**: Missing dependency in Cargo.toml
- **Solution**: Added `dirs = "5.0"` to dependencies
- **Impact**: Application can now handle cross-platform directory creation
