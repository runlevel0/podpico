## Session 1 - 2025-06-02 - User Story #1 Implementation

### Session Info
- **Phase**: 1 (MVP Core)
- **Week**: 1-2 (Project Setup & Basic Infrastructure)
- **Duration**: ~3 hours
- **Agent**: AI Agent Session 1
- **Objectives**: Implement User Story #1 (Add podcast subscription via RSS URL) with complete database foundation

### Pre-Session State
- Project structure complete with backend stubs
- All dependencies configured
- Application compiles successfully
- No functional features implemented yet

### Session Activities

#### 1. Database Schema Implementation ✅
**Objective**: Create complete SQLite schema for User Stories #1-11

**Implementation Details:**
- **Podcasts Table**: id, name, rss_url (unique), description, artwork_url, website_url, timestamps
- **Episodes Table**: id, podcast_id (FK), title, description, episode_url, published_date, duration, file_size, local_file_path, status (new/unlistened/listened), downloaded, on_device, timestamps
- **USB Devices Table**: id, device_name, device_path, last_connected
- **Episode Transfers Table**: id, episode_id (FK), device_id (FK), transferred_at, file_path_on_device

**Key Features:**
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete
- Status validation with CHECK constraints
- Comprehensive metadata storage
- Support for USB device tracking

**Database Operations Implemented:**
- `add_podcast()`: Insert podcast with metadata
- `get_podcasts()`: Retrieve all podcasts with episode counts
- `get_podcast_by_id()`: Get specific podcast with episode statistics
- `remove_podcast()`: Delete podcast and cascade to episodes
- `get_episodes()`: Get episodes for specific podcast or all new episodes
- `update_episode_status()`: Change episode status (new/unlistened/listened)
- `add_episode()`: Insert episode with full metadata

#### 2. RSS Manager Implementation ✅
**Objective**: Implement RSS feed validation and parsing for User Story #1

**User Story #1 Acceptance Criteria Implementation:**
- ✅ **5-second validation timeout**: Used `tokio::time::timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))`
- ✅ **Clear error messages**: Specific error types for different failure modes
- ✅ **URL validation**: Checks for http/https protocol
- ✅ **RSS format validation**: Validates XML structure and required fields

**RSS Parsing Features:**
- **Feed Validation**: Basic URL format, HTTP response validation, RSS XML parsing
- **Podcast Metadata Extraction**: Title, description, artwork URL (iTunes extension + standard image)
- **Website URL Extraction**: From RSS channel link field
- **Episode Parsing**: Title, description, episode URL, published date, duration (iTunes extension)
- **Duration Parsing**: Supports multiple formats (seconds, MM:SS, HH:MM:SS)

**Error Handling:**
- Network timeouts and connection errors
- Invalid RSS format errors
- Empty or malformed feed content
- HTTP error status codes

#### 3. Commands Integration ✅
**Objective**: Integrate RSS validation with database operations

**User Story #1 Complete Implementation:**
```rust
pub async fn add_podcast(rss_url: String) -> Result<Podcast, String>
```

**Implementation Flow:**
1. **Validate RSS feed** (5-second timeout) - meets acceptance criteria
2. **Fetch and parse RSS content** - extract podcast metadata
3. **Save podcast to database** - with all extracted metadata
4. **Parse and save episodes** - with duration, publish date, etc.
5. **Return created podcast** - with episode counts

**Episode Processing:**
- Extracts episode title, description, URL, published date
- Parses iTunes duration format (supports HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, SS)
- Saves all episodes with "new" status by default
- Handles missing or malformed episode data gracefully

#### 4. Application Initialization ✅
**Objective**: Set up database initialization on application startup

**Implementation:**
- Creates `./data` directory in project root
- Initializes SQLite database with proper file permissions
- Creates all tables on first run
- Initializes global managers (database, RSS) for command access
- Comprehensive error handling with application exit on failure

**Database Connection:**
- Uses SQLite with local file storage
- Connection string: `sqlite:./data/podcasts.db`
- Automatic table creation on startup
- Proper error handling for connection failures

#### 5. Frontend Test Interface ✅
**Objective**: Create test interface for User Story #1 validation

**Features Implemented:**
- **Add Podcast Form**: RSS URL input with validation
- **Podcast List Display**: Shows all added podcasts with metadata
- **Test RSS URLs**: Pre-populated buttons for popular podcast feeds
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages for failed operations
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during RSS validation
- **Responsive Design**: Works in light and dark modes

**Test RSS URLs Provided:**
- NPR Up First: `https://feeds.npr.org/510289/podcast.xml`
- CNN Top Stories: `https://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss`
- Stuff You Should Know: `https://feeds.megaphone.fm/HSW2398973788`

**UI Components:**
- Podcast addition form with real-time validation
- Podcast list with metadata display (title, URL, description, episode counts)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading indicators during RSS processing

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

#### Issue 1: SQLite Connection Path
- **Problem**: Database connection failed with "unable to open database file" error
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect SQLite URL format and missing file creation
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed from `sqlite://` to `sqlite:` URL format
  - Added explicit database file creation before connection
  - Used local `./data` directory instead of system data directory
- **Impact**: Database now initializes successfully on all platforms

#### Issue 2: Rust Borrow Checker Error
- **Problem**: Cannot use `episodes` after moving it in for loop
- **Root Cause**: `for item in episodes` moves the vector, preventing later access to `episodes.len()`
- **Solution**: Changed to `for item in &episodes` to borrow instead of move
- **Impact**: Can now access episode count after processing episodes

#### Issue 3: Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: `dirs` crate not found during compilation
- **Root Cause**: Missing dependency in Cargo.toml
- **Solution**: Added `dirs = "5.0"` to dependencies
- **Impact**: Application can now handle cross-platform directory creation
