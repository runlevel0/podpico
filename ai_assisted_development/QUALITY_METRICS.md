   - Fix every single warning before proceeding
   - Set up pre-commit hook to prevent future warnings

2. **Implement Testing Framework** (0% coverage currently)
   - Add testing dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Create test modules for all existing functionality
   - Achieve ≥80% test coverage for User Stories #1, #2, #5, #6, #7
   - Set up cargo-tarpaulin for coverage measurement

3. **Set Up Quality Gates** (currently missing)
   - Implement pre-session quality verification
   - Set up continuous quality checking workflow
   - Create session completion checklist automation

### HIGH PRIORITY ⚠️
4. **Automated Security Scanning**

## Conclusion (UPDATED)

**CRITICAL STATUS**: The project has excellent functional quality for implemented features, but FAILS the new mandatory quality standards that are essential for sustainable development.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
1. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Resolve all 6 clippy warnings (BLOCKS development)
2. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive testing framework (BLOCKS development)  
3. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Set up quality gates and enforcement (BLOCKS development)
4. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Achieve ≥80% test coverage for existing user stories

**DEVELOPMENT BLOCKED**: No new features can be developed until testing framework and quality gates are implemented.

**Overall Assessment**: Strong functional foundation with CRITICAL quality infrastructure gaps that must be resolved immediately to prevent technical debt accumulation and ensure sustainable development velocity.
