- [ ] Verify no breaking changes in quality metrics
- [ ] Update any architectural decisions

## 🔧 Post-Update Verification

### Run Documentation Verification Again
```bash
npm run doc:verify
```
**Expected Result:** ✅ ALL DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION PASSED

### Run Full Quality Pipeline
```bash
npm run quality:full
```
**Expected Result:** All quality checks should pass

### Verify Consistency
- [ ] All timestamps should reflect current session date
- [ ] Test counts should be consistent across documents
- [ ] Issue statuses should match current project state
- [ ] Progress percentages should reflect actual completion

## 📊 Session Success Criteria

✅ **Documentation Complete** when:
- [ ] All 5 core documentation files updated
- [ ] `npm run doc:verify` passes without warnings
- [ ] All timestamps reflect current session
- [ ] Session notes capture all major work performed
- [ ] Progress reflects actual project advancement
- [ ] Quality metrics match current test/build status

## 🚀 Quality Integration

This checklist is integrated with the quality pipeline:
- Documentation verification runs as part of `npm run quality`
- Warnings are acceptable (exit code 2) for quality pipeline
- Failures (exit code 1) will block quality pipeline
- Use `npm run quality:full` for comprehensive checks including docs

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Update as you go**: Don't wait until session end to update docs
2. **Be specific**: Include concrete numbers, file names, and outcomes
3. **Maintain consistency**: Use consistent terminology across documents
4. **Test your updates**: Always run doc verification after updates
5. **Link related work**: Reference user stories, issues, and technical decisions

**Remember:** Good documentation is as important as good code. This checklist ensures the next developer (AI or human) can understand exactly what was accomplished and what needs to happen next.
