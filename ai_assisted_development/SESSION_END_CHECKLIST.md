- [ ] Add new issues discovered during session
- [ ] Update issue priorities based on current project state
- [ ] Ensure all critical issues have proper status

### 5. AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md ‚úÖ
**Update If Changed:**
- [ ] Project status overview
- [ ] Technical setup instructions
- [ ] Quality standards
- [ ] Testing framework status
- [ ] Known limitations or blockers

## üéØ Session-Specific Updates

### Major Feature Implementation
- [ ] Update user story completion in PROGRESS.md
- [ ] Add new tests to quality metrics
- [ ] Document any new dependencies or setup requirements

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Mark related issues as resolved in ISSUES.md
- [ ] Update quality metrics if tests were added/fixed
- [ ] Document fix details in SESSION_NOTES.md

### Infrastructure Changes
- [ ] Update AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md with new setup requirements
- [ ] Update quality pipelines documentation
- [ ] Add new scripts to documentation

### Refactoring
- [ ] Update affected components in documentation
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes in quality metrics
- [ ] Update any architectural decisions

## üîß Post-Update Verification

### Run Documentation Verification Again
```bash
npm run doc:verify
```
**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ ALL DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION PASSED

### Run Full Quality Pipeline
```bash
npm run quality:full
```
**Expected Result:** All quality checks should pass

### Verify Consistency
- [ ] All timestamps should reflect current session date
- [ ] Test counts should be consistent across documents
- [ ] Issue statuses should match current project state
- [ ] Progress percentages should reflect actual completion

## üìä Session Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Documentation Complete** when:
- [ ] All 5 core documentation files updated
- [ ] `npm run doc:verify` passes without warnings
- [ ] All timestamps reflect current session
- [ ] Session notes capture all major work performed
- [ ] Progress reflects actual project advancement
- [ ] Quality metrics match current test/build status

## üöÄ Quality Integration

This checklist is integrated with the quality pipeline:
- Documentation verification runs as part of `npm run quality`
- Warnings are acceptable (exit code 2) for quality pipeline
- Failures (exit code 1) will block quality pipeline
- Use `npm run quality:full` for comprehensive checks including docs

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Update as you go**: Don't wait until session end to update docs
2. **Be specific**: Include concrete numbers, file names, and outcomes
3. **Maintain consistency**: Use consistent terminology across documents
4. **Test your updates**: Always run doc verification after updates
5. **Link related work**: Reference user stories, issues, and technical decisions

**Remember:** Good documentation is as important as good code. This checklist ensures the next developer (AI or human) can understand exactly what was accomplished and what needs to happen next.
